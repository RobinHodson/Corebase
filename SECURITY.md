# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

There will be no security updates until I work out how they could apply.
This is just about meetings; no software should be hosted here.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, or a concern of one, raise a comment in the Discussions.

Updates and discussions on a reported vulnerability are likely to be a low priority.
The vulnerability report will probably be declined as of concern, but may be accepted purely as a discussion.
